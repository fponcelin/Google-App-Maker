This web app provided a user-friendly UI for the People team to request new starters' company Google accounts to the IT team.

Upon approval by the IT team, the account would automatically be generated, added to the correct groups (based on their location and team, selected by the requester in the UI) and emails would be sent to all relevant parties.
