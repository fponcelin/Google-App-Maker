Web app providing the People team and IT a user-friendly interface for managing company leavers (frequently used when working with freelancers coming and going on a per-project basis).

The user would pick an employee from a drop-down, the app auto-filling all the relevant fields for the user to verify they picked the correct person. They would set a data retention policy and submit the request to IT.

Upon approval from IT, the app would automatically deprovision and suspend the user's company Google account, remove them from mailing groups and rename their email address for retention.

If the user were to come back during the retention period, the People team would have the ability to request their account to be restored. The app would rename and reactivate the account as it was originally and restore all the mailing groups membership.

After the retention time has passed, IT would have the ability to permanently delete the suspended user account from a convenient list showing accounts eligible for deletion.
